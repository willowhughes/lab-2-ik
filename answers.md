1. The summed link lengths are 1.1925 meters. That leads me to assume the maximum reach is approximately 1.2 meters.

2. The arm failed to reach even 1, getting equally close in (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0) and (1, 0, 0) directions. I think it is because the link length is measured from the "end of the segment" which results in counting linking parts of the arm that don't add to reach length.
